# Hotel-Management-System

Description:
This project is a simple console-based Hotel Management System implemented in C. The application simulates a restaurant ordering system for a fictional hotel, "Hotel Taj," allowing users to place orders from a predefined menu of biryanis.
Platform - Turbo c++

Key Features:

Menu Display: The system presents a menu with four types of biryanis, each with a specific price.
Order Management: Users can select items from the menu and specify quantities, with the system calculating the total amount dynamically.
User Interaction: The program prompts users to continue ordering or exit, providing a user-friendly experience.
Total Calculation: It maintains a running total of the order amount, displaying the final total upon completion.
Technical Details:

The code utilizes basic input/output functions from the standard C library (stdio.h and conio.h for console manipulation).
The program manages menu selection and order quantities using control structures such as loops and switches.
The layout of the console output is structured for clarity, ensuring a pleasant user experience.
This project demonstrates fundamental programming skills in C, focusing on control flow, user input handling, and simple arithmetic operations. It is an excellent representation of how to develop a functional application in a console environment, suitable for showcasing during interviews or academic assessments.
